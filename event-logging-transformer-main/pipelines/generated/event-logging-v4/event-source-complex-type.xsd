If not specified this element is considered to be true as most movement through a door removes access to previously accessible zones. Removal of all access zones provides anti pass-back protection.</xs:documentation>

To achieve this it may be necessary to map the user identifier in an application to a common user identifier when populating this element. Where an identifier exists that is unique across the organisation, such as a distinguished name (User DN) from a certificate authority or directory service, then this should be used in the &lt;Id&gt; element in preference to any other user identifier.</xs:documentation>

               <xs:documentation>In some cases an account may switch to another account in order to run a process or perform a privileged action, e.g. use of sudo. Where this happens the &lt;User&gt; element should still refer to the real user and this element should indicate what the temporary user was when the event was created, e.g. root. This is also often used when a system user (processing account) executes scheduled jobs on behalf of the real user that scheduled the job. Where an identifier exists that is unique across the organisation, such as a distinguished name (User DN) from a certificate authority or directory service, then this should be used in the &lt;Id&gt; element in preference to any other user identifier.</xs:documentation>

This element will be false where an event may have been created after the user was present, e.g. where scheduled processing is performed or an action has been queued for execution later, as is the case when some form of asynchronous processing is used. All interactive events must provide the Id for the user. Can be omitted if true as this is the default.</xs:documentation>
