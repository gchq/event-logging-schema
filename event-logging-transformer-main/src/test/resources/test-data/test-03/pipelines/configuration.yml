#Each pipeline configuration will be run against the sourceSchema

#pipelineName     - The name of the pipeline
#basePipelineName - The name of a pipeline that this pipeline extends, e.g. if pipeline X has transforms X1,X2 and
#                   pipeline Y has transforms Y1,Y2 and the base pipeline of X is Y, then the effective transforms of
#                   X will be Y1,Y2,X1,X2
#outputSuffix     - Optional suffix to apply to the generated xsd file and 'id' attribute,
#                   e.g. event-logging-v<majorVersion>-<suffix>.xsd
#                   e.g. id="event-logging-v<majorVersion>-<suffix>"
#outputBaseName   - Optional base name for the generated xsd file and 'id' attribute, if not supplied the
#                   name of the source schema will be used.
#                   e.g. <baseName>-v<majorVersion>-<suffix>.xsd.
#                   e.g. id="event-logging-v<majorVersion>-<suffix>"
#hasOutput        - True if this pipeline should produce a schema file
#transformations  - An ordered list of the xslt files that make up a pipeline of relative transformations.
#                   Each transformation will be applied to the result of the preceding transformation
#                   Each file must exist in the directory './transformations' where '.' is the directory
#                   of this configuration file.
