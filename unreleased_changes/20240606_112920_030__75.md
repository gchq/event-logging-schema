* Issue **#75** : Add `Deltas` to `Update` to allow recording of a change where the before/after state is not known or is too large to record, e.g. adding a user to an long allow-list. Change `Update.After` to be 0-1 to allow flexibility in recording an update.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Add concept of a Delta to `UpdateComplexType`
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/event-logging-schema/issues/75
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
