  A guide to the different variants of the schema and the process that creates them.
---

The schema has a number of different variants that are all derived from the master `event-logging.xsd` schema in the root of this repository.
The following variants are published as release artefacts:

| Suffix | Description |
| -- | -- |
| - | The full schema for use by stroom to validate decorated events. |
| `client` | The client schema for use by client systems and the event-logging Java library for sending un-decorated events. Lacks some `<UserDetails>` child elements, adds an `<Event>` root element to allow clients to send individual events and removes the `Event/@Id` attribute as this is for use on decorated events only. |
| `safe` | A version of the schema for validating data from untrusted sources. It limits the number of occurrences of elements and the characters that can be used. |

These variants are generated by the java application in `event-logging-transformer-main/` which is configured by `event-logging-transformer-main/pipelines/configuration.yml`.

This Java application is run as part of the Gradle build.
The generated schemas are output to `event-logging-transformer-main/pipelines/generated/`
