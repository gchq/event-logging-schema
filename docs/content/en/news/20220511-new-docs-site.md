  A refresh of the schema documentation site for a new look and feel.
---

The Schema documentation has been re-vamped with a new look and feel.
The documentation is now versioned so that you are only reading documentation applicable to one minor version of the schema.

Other improvements:

* Addtion of News and Releases sections
* Better site and page navigation with the left and right hand menus
* Tagging of content to help find related material
