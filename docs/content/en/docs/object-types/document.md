# Document
This is used to describe any form of digital document, such as a Word document, PDF or a simple text file, along with its location and most recent created/modified/accessed times.

The `<Permissions>` element that is part of the base object structure can be used to define all the user/group permissions in place on the document in the case of a document management system or similar.
