# Chat
This is used to describe a single message in an instant messaging application.  The `<SessionId>` element can be populated to allow multiple events for the same chat session to be associated at a later date.  This is used for direct user to user chat as opposed to `<GroupChat>` which is used for chatting to a group of users via a chat room.

A chat message is typically modelled as `<Create>/<Chat>`.
