# File
This is used to describe any kind of file on a file system or file repository, e.g. a data file, log file, backup file, etc.  The `<Media>` element can be used to describe the type of media it is stored on.  The hash of the file can also be recorded using `<Hash>` so the actual version of the file interacted with is known. If a hash is supplied then the name of the hashing algorithm should also be supplied in the `Type` attribute.
