# User
This is used to describe a user entity in a system.  This could be the user account in a web application, the identity of a person in an access control system, a user profile in a chat application or a user account on a piece of configurable hardware.

The full details of the user can also be recorded, such as the position within the organisation, if known. 

It is important to consider that the user account is not necessarily under the control of the person to whom the account has been assigned.
